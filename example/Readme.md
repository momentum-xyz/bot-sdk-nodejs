# Examples

This directory contains examples of how to use the SDK.

You can run the examples by using the following command:

```
npm start <example_filename>
```

Some examples support connecting Bot as User by providing private key in `BOT_SDK_PRIVATE_KEY` environment variable.

Export it once in your terminal before running the example:

```
export BOT_SDK_PRIVATE_KEY=<private_key>
```

or provide it in the same command:

```
BOT_SDK_PRIVATE_KEY=<private_key> npm start <example_filename>
```
